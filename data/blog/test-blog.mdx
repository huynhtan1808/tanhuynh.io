Have you ever visited a website and been completely in awe of the elegance and simplicity of its design? For me, that website is [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Stripe is a company that allows people and businesses to accept payments online and in mobile apps. That doesn't sound like a company that would have an exquisite website design, but look at how Stripe describes themselves on their about page.

> "We think that building an internet business is a problem rooted in code and design, not finance."

Rather than making design an afterthought, it's treated as a first-class citizen at Stripe. You can almost feel the hours of work spent iterating over designs and making minor tweaks when viewing the website's pages. In this article, I'm going to break down how Stripe creates these beautiful designs and give some tips and tricks to web designers and developers alike.

### The Design



Pictured above is the design for Stripe's main landing page. At first glance, here's what really sticks out to me:

1.  Crisp typography
2.  Stunning color palette
3.  High-quality images
4.  Bold call-to-action buttons

Let's start with the first observation: the font.

### Typography

Stripe uses a font called [Camphor](https://www.fontshop.com/families/camphor). It's a modern, uncluttered, sans serif font designed by Nick Job in 2010. It _really_ shines here and looks great in a variety of weights.



Typography is arguably the most important part of your design since it's the medium for your content. Stripe does an excellent job of using different weights and colors to provide adequate contrast. This draws your attention to the things that matter most.



Let's see how we can make our font as crisp and clear as possible. First, we'll define our font family to be Camphor along with some fallback fonts. **Note:** Camphor is not free and should be purchased if you're planning to use it in production. However, I did find a [gist containing the font](https://gist.github.com/bdno86/d1f49b6f533df3f832b39d6cc3194303) which you can mess around with.

We can utilize the `text-rendering` CSS property to allow us to choose quality over speed, as well as some vendor specific properties to make our font sharper. **Note:** These should work for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on Mac.

```css
body {
  font-family: Camphor, Open Sans, Segoe UI, sans-serif;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

### Example

In this example, I apply `-webkit-font-smoothing` followed by `text-rendering`.
